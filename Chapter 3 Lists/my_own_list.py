# 9/29/19 Made a list of vehicles and wrote a anecdote about them.
vehicles = ['Duke 360', '1972 Super Beetle',
            'Toyota Sunrader', 'Volkswagon Thing']
first = f"My favorite car has always been a {vehicles[-1]}."
second = f"Although, I would love to rebuild a {vehicles[1]} as a family car."
thrid = f"A {vehicles[-2]} would be cool to drive across the country,"
last = f"but riding a {vehicles[0]} down to Argentina would be a dream come true!"

print(first)
